      <description>Date/Time: 2007-10-26 05:45:00
Details: Jimmy Deguara reported a tornado on the ground with debris swirl. The tornado was stationary and growing larger into a large cone. Debris hit a substation. The event was captured on film. A left moving supercell moved NE through the Northen Rivers towards Lismore during the afternoon. The cell weakened slightly as it came into Lismore city, but just as it was past Lismore it interacted with some weaker cells moving towards the SW with the general flow. This generated a tornado that impacted on the town of Dunoon. The SES received 116 RFA's for this event, damage was initially estimated to be in excess of $2 million, and the area was declared a natural disaster zone.</description>

      <description>Date/Time: 2007-10-26 05:46:00
Details: Tornado at Dunoon sighted by Alan Hunter in Corndale, about 5km to the east. A left moving supercell moved NE through the Northen Rivers towards Lismore during the afternoon. The cell weakened slightly as it came into Lismore city, but just as it was past Lismore it interacted with some weaker cells moving towards the SW with the general flow. This generated a tornado that impacted on the town of Dunoon. The SES received 116 RFA's for this event, damage was initially estimated to be in excess of $2 million, and the area was declared a natural disaster zone.</description>

Details: Storm description provided by property owner (Ian Bidstrip). Area visited briefly by D. Griffiths and J. Pethick several weeks later. Damage path started about 1 km east of Mintaro, and extended SE over 2-2.5 km. The roof of a 100 year old stone building (shearers quarters), including the timbers and ceiling, was torn off. The main section of the roof ended up 300 metres to the southeast. Stoves and fridges in the building were shifted around. Shearers in the building described it going 'deathly quiet', then there was a noise that sounded like a jet engine had started up next door.  They felt it was lucky no-one was killed. Ian said he lost lots of trees as well, some up to 120 years old. Witness estimated time as 1230Z, radar suggests closer to 1245Z. Tornado near Mintaro (MN);  22 Sept 1998. Damage to shearers quarters and trees. Path 50 m wide and 2-2.5 km long. Rated at low end of F1.</description>

Details: At 7pm a suspected tornado caused a narrow swathe of damage through Rockingham/Waikiki about 50m wide by 2.5 km in length. About 70 houses sustained damage along this path mostly to roofing, fences and patios/pergolas. Residents described the typical 'roaring sound' as it came through. The damage seemed consistent with an F1 tornado (winds in the range of 118 - 178 km/h), and an inspection of fallen freeway road signs by a structural engineer indicated a failure at 150 km/h. 23 July 2007. Rottnest Island, Cape Leeuwin, Cape Naturaliste and Busselton gusts. Tornados in Rockingham and Meckering.</description>

Gary Higgins, coop observer at Mango Farm, rang in a report at 1600 CST Friday 5 Oct:  Had a very blowy storm, reported 40 knots at 1500 obs, but said gusts after the obs were much stronger.  The winds lifted 40X20 metre hayshed and dropped it upside down some distance away.  Blew a 4m boat on a trailer through a fence. Blew a large branch onto a new car.  Smashed a window in their house.  Lots of branches down and rubbish all over the place.</description>

Details: A relatively slow moving front caused a period of heavy rain about the lower west coast and a tornado in Roleystone. The trail of damage extended discontinuously for at least 2km, being about 50m wide along a bearing from 310 to 130 degrees. A few houses sustained significant roof damage. Being through semi-rural area most of the impact was to trees with some large trees snapped off at various heights above the base. While most trees fell to the ESE there were some at other directions. Roof debris indicated a clockwise circulation. The event occurred at 2:30pm and witnesses described the typical roar/jet engine sound associated with previous tornado events. A preliminary estimate of winds based on some of the most severe tree damage was put at 150-200 km/h by wind engineer Geoff Boughton.

Details: Damage consistent with the passage of a tornado was reported near Cranbrook about 9:45am on 21 May ahead of the front. A strong cold front and deep low produced heavy rain, severe winds and abnormally high tides/beach erosion across the SWLD Division on 21 and 22 May 2009. Damage consistent with the passage of a tornado was reported near Cranbrook about 9:45am on 21 May ahead of the front. Dust storms were reported ahead of the front in strong and squally NW winds. The maximum Geraldton to Albany pressure gradient was 14.6 hPa between 1247 and 1253 WST on 21 May and 17.0 hPa at 1135 and 1841 WST on 22 May.</description>

Details: A tornado passed through Bunbury south of the city centre at about 10:50 WST on a cell in the post frontal airmass. Damage along a narrow WSW-ENE path of several kilometres. SES report four houses with roof completely off and about seven others major roof damage and 20 others with minor roof damage. Geoff Boughton did an inspection and reported evidence of rotation in damage path. Major roof damage was to tin roofed houses while tiled houses were mainly damaged from debris impact. Width about 30m extending along a discontinuous path of about 3 km (from the coast to the cemetery). Eye-witnesses report characteristic 'roaring' sound and swirling debris without funnel cloud. One report from someone 50m away who was totally oblivious to it all and could not tell that anything had happened. Followed by a large quantity of hail. Estimated wind at roof level 100-140 km/h (120-160km/h at 10m) equivalent of F1 tornado. A moderate front passed across during the morning causing a tornado at Bunbury and severe wind gusts at coastal sites.
A tornado passed through Bunbury south of the city centre at about 10:50 WST on a cell in the post frontal airmass. Damage along a narrow WSW-ENE path of several kilometres. Followed by a large quantity of hail. Estimated wind at roof level 100-140 km/h (120-160km/h at 10m) equivalent of F1 tornado. In Kalamunda trees fell on a roof and powerlines, one Ocean Reef house sustained roof damage and one house at Dardanup sustained signficant roof damage. Total of 33 SES callouts in Metro area.

The passage of the front did coincide with the high tide with surge values of between 0.4 and 0.5m. At Barrack St Jetty the tide peaked at 1.58m at 9:30 WST which caused the Swan River to overtop the barrier at Como but did not encroach significantlyupon the Freeway, and waters lapped over the wall along Riverside Drive.%D</description>

Details: Damage consisted with the passage of a tornado was reported near Bokal at 1630 WST then Katanning about 1700 on the 24th. At Bokal: trees were reported to have been ripped out of the ground, there was some small hail and several claps of thunder. Damage path (NW-SE) was about 100-130m wide and about 3km in length but could have been longer. Between Katanning and Kojonup: Tree damage was reported as well as fences down and roofs ripped of houses. 4 silos were blown away and smashed. Very little rain was reported with the tornado. The damage path was about 3-4km in length and had a maximum width of about 100m. An eyewitness reported seeing the tornado (funnel cloud extending to the ground) after it had passed through this property on the Kojonup-Katanning road near the intersection with Marron Pool road. The cell which spawned the tornado is evident on the Albany radar with the strongest reflectivities at 0905 UTC between Katanning and Kojonup. A convergence line produced a wind gust of 53 knots (98 km/h) at Cape Naturaliste at 1537 WST (23/06) and 52 knots (96 km/h) at Rottnest Island at 1611 WST (23/06).
A rainband moved over southwest parts of the state overnight on the 23rd then a deep low and associated cold front affected most parts of the SWLD on the 24th. In the 24hrs to 9am on the 24th, Cowaramup recorded 45.2mm and Margaret River 42.6mm. In the 24hrs to 9am on the 25th, Dwellingup recorded 45.2mm and Pinjarra 44.6mm.

Details: Tornado observed at The Summit (near Stanthorpe) around 12pm AEST. Media articles report of trees pulled from the ground (10 acres of pine trees flattened), two houses demolished (Queenslander alledgedly lifed off its stumps), fruit crops battered, hail netting shredded and sheds destroyed. A major severe convective outbreak. A confirmed tornado of F1-F2 intensity was photographed around midday at The Summit, near Stanthorpe, where it shredded hail nets protecting a cherry crop, lifted a Queenslander house off its stumps, and completely destroyed another house and a pumping shed. Two other suspected tornadoes occurred at Mt Nebo and Biggenden.  A major hailstorm occurred on the Gold Coast with the worst affected areas being Currumbin, Palm Beach, and Coolangatta. Hail was golf ball to cricket ball sized. 400 homes were damaged, many cars were written off, and birds and animals at the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary were killed. A Qantas jet was badly damaged after taking off into the hailstorm. Later, golf ball hail also disrupted the Indy 500 car race.  Another major severe storm moved from the Samford / Mt Nebo area through Brisbaneâs northern suburbs and Redcliffe. This storm produced hail up to golf ball size and significant wind damage, particularly in the Samford / Mt Nebo area where 90 homes were damaged. A damage track through forest near Mt Nebo was observed from the air suggesting the storm may have been tornadic.%D Other severe storms occurred in the Esk/Laidley/Ipswich area (tree and power line damage, some roof damage), the south Burnett (tree and roofing damage at Eidsvold and Blackbutt, golf ball hail in the Nanango and Burnett Heads areas), Biggenden (possible tornado â a damage track 500m wide and a kilometer long), Baralaba (golf ball hail), Warwick (hail to 5cm, 100 km/h wind gust measured, some flash flooding), and as far north as Rockhampton (94 km/h wind gust measured).%D Insurance claims for the event totaled $15-20 million with 772 SES jobs on the Gold Coast alone.</description>

Two other suspected tornadoes occurred at Mt Nebo and Biggenden.%D A major hailstorm occurred on the Gold Coast with the worst affected areas being Currumbin, Palm Beach, and Coolangatta. Hail was golf ball to cricket ball sized. 400 homes were damaged, many cars were written off, and birds and animals at the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary were killed. A Qantas jet was badly damaged after taking off into the hailstorm. Later, golf ball hail also disrupted the Indy 500 car race.%D Another major severe storm moved from the Samford / Mt Nebo area through Brisbaneâs northern suburbs and Redcliffe. This storm produced hail up to golf ball size and significant wind damage, particularly in the Samford / Mt Nebo area where 90 homes were damaged. A damage track through forest near Mt Nebo was observed from the air suggesting the storm may have been tornadic.%D Other severe storms occurred in the Esk/Laidley/Ipswich area (tree and power line damage, some roof damage), the south Burnett (tree and roofing damage at Eidsvold and Blackbutt, golf ball hail in the Nanango and Burnett Heads areas), Biggenden (possible tornado â a damage track 500m wide and a kilometer long), Baralaba (golf ball hail), Warwick (hail to 5cm, 100 km/h wind gust measured, some flash flooding), and as far north as Rockhampton (94 km/h wind gust measured).%D Insurance claims for the event totaled $15-20 million with 772 SES jobs on the Gold Coast alone.%D</description>

Details: Tornado observed at Bundamba (east of Ipswich) at around 4:30pm AEST. Media articles report of a half-finished house destroyed at Bundamba and other homes having some roof damage, though there are no images of the damage and therefore confidence in the assigned Fujita number is not high. Report of damage at the Racecourse Hotel due to considerable airborne debris, including a mango smashing a Hungry Jacks sign. A wind gust of 111km/h was recorded at the Amberley Automatic Weather Station. A severe thunderstorm moved through Ipswich and Brisbane producing wind damage and some flash flooding. A tornado was reported from Bundamba, as well as golf ball sized hail. Amberley aerodrome recorded a highest wind gust of 60 knots (111 km/h).</description>

Details: Tornado observed at Beenleigh at around 4:20pm AEST. Numerous damage reports were received from across southeast Queensland, though it is difficult to ascertain if any damage was due to the tornado. Yet another line of severe thunderstorms moved across southeast Queensland. Widespread damage resulted, particularly in the Brisbane (wind) and Gympie (hail) areas. A tornado was sighted near Beenleigh. The roof of an entire unit block at New Farm was torn off. Two young girls were injured by a falling tree on a university campus at St Lucia. Measured wind gusts included Cape Moreton â 55 knots (102 km/h), Cleveland â 59 knots (109 km/h), and Banana Bank â 66 knots (122 km/h). More than 100,000 homes and businesses were blacked out. Elsewhere golf ball hail occurred at Stanthorpe and Woodford, while hail to cricket ball size caused considerable damage at Gympie.</description>

Details: Possible tornado around Rosedale and the Baffle Creek at around 4:50pm AEST. Reports of houses unroofed and trees snapped in Rosedale. A shed was alledgedly lifted and carried about a kilometre. A garage was totally destroyed. A water tank of unknown origin was dumped next to the dam of a property. Golf ball hail also accompanied the storm, destroying watermelon and passionfruit crops. There are no images of the damage and therefore confidence in the assigned Fujita number is not high and it is possible that it could have been an F2 event. Severe storms affected the Wide Bay and Burnett district. A possible tornado struck the Rosedale area (50km NW of Bundaberg) â houses were unroofed, trees snapped, and a shed was lifted and carried about a kilometre. Golf ball sized hail also accompanied the storm. Hail the size of cricket balls was reported from another storm near Boompa (southeast of Biggenden), while hail damage to mango and avocado crops was reported from Childers. </description>

Details:  One long-lived thunderstorm, which formed just ahead of the cold front, tracked across LSE, from near Robe, through Penola and into western Vic, during the late afternoon/early evening. The storm spawned a tornado, which ripped a narrow path of damage through the town of Penola. About forty buildings were damaged, several homes suffered severe damage, rendering them uninhabitable. The bowling clubhouse was destroyed, hardware store unroofed and several businesses suffered smashed windows and collapsed walls. Damage path was 6 km long, but only 40-50 metres wide, consistent with high end F1, possibly low end F2 intensity. Early estimates put the damage bill at several millions of dollars. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries.%D %D A second tornado spawned from another cell damaged farm buildings and trees on a property at Claywells.

Details: NULL The passage of a cold front during the day produced several waterspouts around the Perth area and a likely tornado in Bunbury. A narrow swathe of damage around 700 m long was reported from the Bunbury suburb of Usher around 1 pm WST. DFES reported about 10 call outs for damage to trees, fences, patio, tiles and ridge capping. The Serpentine radar image at 0450 UTC showed an enhanced cell approaching the coast to the south of the city with an unusual velocity signal at an elevation of approximately 10 000 feet. The environment was more unstable than the usual winter time front. The cell formed over the ocean to the west of Bunbury where CAPE values in ACCESS R fields were between 200 and 500 J/Kg. The storm cell formed in the warm air mass ahead of the front on a northerly to northwest convergence line. ACCESS R fields indicated some areas of overlap of shear, instability and up motion.</description>

Details: A clear and narrow damage path was noted during this event which is supported by the radar signatures at the time. The strongest evidence to support tornadic activity is a gust of 213km/h at Kurnell AWS at 10.33am, with SES reports confirming the removal of rooves from houses and uprooting of mature trees in the area. A range of images from online social and news media also show damage to a number of properties in Kurnell, an over turned truck, and the partial removal of the roof of the desalination plant. The strength of the observed wind gust and onsite visual evidence of the damage place this tornado in the F2 category. Later reports emerged (~11.40am) from head office media stating a number of callers from Bondi Beach sighting a tornado. Based on radar data at this time and no specific damage reports it was most likely offshore. LGA: Sutherland Shire. NULL</description>

      <description>Date/Time: 2016-01-22 05:00:00
Details: A highly organised supercell thunderstorm was evident on radar west of Jerrys Plains around 3pm. This cell tracked slowly east towards Singleton by 4.30pm, then northeast towards Nabiac by 6.30pm. Doppler radar showed a clearly defined low level velocity couplet lasting for over an hour with this storm, weakening once the cell tracked past Singleton. The SES reported significant damage at Doyles Creek and Singleton, including some roofs partially or fully lifted off, trees down on roads, and some trees crushing cars. Secondhand reports (friend of a storm spotter) were received of tornado damage at the Darley and Coolmore Horse Studs and mines including trees ripped out of the ground. The location of this report is consistent with the position of the low level velocity couplet. One photo on social media shows a mature tree with large branches broken off and a wire fence bent over at Jerrys Plains, with all debris aligned in the same direction. Tornadic activity seems likely but difficult to estimate path lengths or EF scales without more detailed investigation. NULL</description>

Details: A strong line of fast moving thunderstorms, possibly supercells, moved through the Forbes Creek/Hoskinstown area late on Saturday night (approximately 11.30pm), spawning at least one tornado. A damage survey conducted onsite showed numerous Eucalypts had been snapped and Pines uprooted, a kit home damaged, shearing shed demolished, and front wall of a double brick structure destroyed. The estimated width of the damage swathe was 150m, with the SES reporting damage along a 3km path. Other reports from the SES include major structural damage to 6 properties in the Forbes Creek/Hoskinstown area, with a number of trees down on access roads. Numerous media articles (SMH, ABC, Canberra Times) were written for this event, and photos posted on the Queanbeyan Facebook page showing significant damage to structures and properties. Estimated strength: EF2. NULL</description>

Details: It was concluded that damage in parts of Townsville matched the specifications of an F2 tornado. The evidence used to come to this conclusion included images of roofs being torn off frame houses, large trees being uprooted and some light objects appearing to have become missiles. The tornado of the event happened in parts of Townsville between the airport and the suburbs of Vincent and Gulliver. Radar evidence indicated the presence of a Bounded Weak Echo Region, which is a characteristic signature of a supercell thunderstorm. The damage assessment conducted by James Cook University indicated a path of damage that correlates with the passage of the supercell signature on radar. The report also noted that tree damage appeared to be convergent across the area, which corresponds more closely to the damage pattern associated with the passage of a tornado. Significant wind gust observations were also recorded around Townsville Airport during the event, including a 3 second wind gust of 111km/h at 5:07am AEST at the Automatic Weather Station and a wind gust of 135km/h at the Dines anemometer.

Details: The report of a tornado at Inkerman (southeast of Ayr) was submitted by a local cane farmer to the Bureau of Meteorology office in Townsville on the 25 January 2013. The exact time of the tornado was unknown, but it is suspected to have occurred on the night of 23 January 2013 or the morning of 24 January 2013. The farmer reported a 200m swath of destruction through his cane field and that the damage appeared to have occurred in a circular fashion. The environment was conducive for tornadoes at the time of the event and radar indicated that there may have been cells with a potential mesocyclone in the area during the assumed time of the tornado event. No Rapid Damage Assessment was conducted in the area by Queensland Fire and Emergency Services to confirm the passage of a tornado, no Doppler radar data was available and no images of the reported damage were provided, so it was difficult to confirm whether the damage could be attributed to a tornado.
