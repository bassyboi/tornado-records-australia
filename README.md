# Adding KML Files to Google Earth Pro

This guide will help you add and view KML files in Google Earth Pro. A KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file contains geographic data and annotations for mapping software like Google Earth Pro.

## Steps to Add a KML File

### Step 1: Open Google Earth Pro
1. Launch Google Earth Pro on your computer. If you don’t have it installed, you can download it from the [Google Earth Pro Download Page](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#earth-pro).

### Step 2: Access the File Menu
1. In the top-left corner of the application, click on **File**.
2. Select **Open** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 3: Locate the KML File
1. Navigate to the location where your KML file is saved on your computer.
   - Example: If you downloaded the KML file, it might be in your "Downloads" folder.
2. Select the KML file (e.g., `tornado_locations_with_details.kml`).
3. Click **Open**.

### Step 4: View the Data
1. The KML file's content will load into the "Places" panel on the left side of the Google Earth Pro interface.
2. Expand the folder under "Temporary Places" to see individual data points or layers.
3. Double-click on any point or layer to zoom in and view the specific location on the map.

### Step 5: Save the KML to "My Places" (Optional)
1. To keep the KML file loaded permanently in Google Earth Pro, right-click on the file or folder under "Temporary Places."
2. Select **Save to My Places**.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found:** Ensure the file is downloaded and accessible on your computer.
- **Invalid File:** Verify the KML file format. It should end with `.kml` or `.kmz`.
- **Data Doesn’t Display Correctly:** Check that the KML file contains valid geographic coordinates.

## Additional Features
- **Edit Placemark Descriptions:** Right-click on a point, select **Properties**, and edit the description.
- **Adjust Visibility:** Toggle the checkboxes next to layers or points to show or hide them.
- **Export Changes:** After editing, you can export the updated file by right-clicking the folder under "My Places" and selecting **Save Place As**.

By following these steps, you can easily load, view, and interact with your KML data in Google Earth Pro.
