# Adding KML Files to Google Earth Pro

This guide will help you add and view KML files in Google Earth Pro. For instance, you might use a KML file to visualize weather patterns, such as tornado tracks, or to map hiking trails with detailed annotations. A KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file contains geographic data and annotations for mapping software like Google Earth Pro.

## Steps to Add a KML File

### Step 1: Open Google Earth Pro

1. Launch Google Earth Pro on your computer. If you don’t have it installed, you can download it from the [Google Earth Pro Download Page](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#earth-pro).

### Step 2: Access the File Menu

1. In the top-left corner of the application, click on **File**.
2. Select **Open** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 3: Locate the KML File

1. Navigate to the location where your KML file is saved on your computer.
   - Example: If you downloaded the KML file, it might be in your "Downloads" folder.
   - Note: Supported file types include `.kml` and `.kmz`.
2. Select the KML file (e.g., `tornado_locations_with_details.kml`).
3. Click **Open**.

### Step 4: View the Data

1. The KML file's content will load into the "Places" panel on the left side of the Google Earth Pro interface.
2. Expand the folder under "Temporary Places" to see individual data points or layers. The "Temporary Places" section acts as a staging area for newly imported files and is not saved automatically unless you choose to do so.
3. Double-click on any point or layer to zoom in and view the specific location on the map.

### Step 5: Save the KML to "My Places" (Optional)

1. To keep the KML file loaded permanently in Google Earth Pro, right-click on the file or folder under "Temporary Places."
2. Select **Save to My Places**.

## Overview of Tornado Data in Australia

Australia experiences approximately 30 to 80 tornadoes annually, although the actual number might be higher due to underreporting in remote areas. These tornadoes vary in intensity and impact. Here are some notable events:

- **1795 Sydney Tornado**: The earliest recorded tornado in Australia occurred in Sydney in 1795, marking the beginning of documented tornado activity.
- **1970 Bulahdelah Tornado**: One of the most powerful tornadoes in Australian history, this event caused significant damage to forests and property in New South Wales.
- **1992 Queensland Storms**: A series of storms produced multiple tornadoes, including an F4 tornado in Bucca, demonstrating the potential for severe weather in the region.
- **2003 Bendigo Tornado**: This tornado impacted Bendigo, Victoria, causing considerable structural damage.
- **2016 South Australia Tornado Outbreak**: At least seven tornadoes occurred on September 28, 2016, leading to a state-wide power outage.

For a comprehensive list of tornadoes in Australia, refer to the [List of Australia Tornadoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australia_tornadoes).

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found:** Ensure the file is downloaded and accessible on your computer.
- **Invalid File:** Verify the KML file format. It should end with `.kml` or `.kmz`.
- **Data Doesn’t Display Correctly:** Check that the KML file contains valid geographic coordinates.

## Additional Features

- **Edit Placemark Descriptions:** Right-click on a point, select **Properties**, and edit the description.
- **Adjust Visibility:** Toggle the checkboxes next to layers or points to show or hide them.
- **Export Changes:** After editing, you can export the updated file by right-clicking the folder under "My Places" and selecting **Save Place As**.

By following these steps, you can easily load, view, and interact with your KML data in Google Earth Pro.
