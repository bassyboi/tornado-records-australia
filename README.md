# Adding KML Files to Google Earth Pro

This guide will help you add and view KML files in Google Earth Pro. For instance, you might use a KML file to visualize weather patterns, such as tornado tracks, or to map hiking trails with detailed annotations. A KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file contains geographic data and annotations for mapping software like Google Earth Pro.

## Steps to Add a KML File

### Step 1: Open Google Earth Pro

1. Launch Google Earth Pro on your computer. If you don’t have it installed, you can download it from the [Google Earth Pro Download Page](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#earth-pro).

### Step 2: Access the File Menu

1. In the top-left corner of the application, click on **File**.
2. Select **Open** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 3: Locate the KML File

1. Navigate to the location where your KML file is saved on your computer.
   - Example: If you downloaded the KML file, it might be in your "Downloads" folder.
   - Note: Supported file types include `.kml` and `.kmz`.
2. Select the KML file (e.g., `tornado_locations_with_details.kml`).
3. Click **Open**.

### Step 4: View the Data

1. The KML file's content will load into the "Places" panel on the left side of the Google Earth Pro interface.
2. Expand the folder under "Temporary Places" to see individual data points or layers. This allows you to access detailed data points and explore specific elements within the KML file. The "Temporary Places" section acts as a staging area for newly imported files and is not saved automatically unless you choose to do so.
3. Double-click on any point or layer to zoom in and view the specific location on the map.

### Step 5: Save the KML to "My Places" (Optional)

1. To keep the KML file loaded permanently in Google Earth Pro, right-click on the file or folder under "Temporary Places."
2. Select **Save to My Places**.

## Overview of Tornado Data in Australia

Australia experiences approximately 30 to 80 tornadoes annually, although the actual number might be higher due to underreporting in remote areas. This underreporting is often due to sparse populations in these areas, which reduces the likelihood of tornadoes being observed and reported. These tornadoes vary in intensity and impact. Here are some notable events:

- **1795 Sydney Tornado**: The earliest recorded tornado in Australia occurred in Sydney in 1795, marking the beginning of documented tornado activity.
- **1970 Bulahdelah Tornado**: One of the most powerful tornadoes in Australian history, this event caused significant damage to forests and property in New South Wales.
- **1992 Queensland Storms**: A series of storms produced multiple tornadoes, including an F4 tornado in Bucca, demonstrating the potential for severe weather in the region.
- **2003 Bendigo Tornado**: This tornado impacted Bendigo, Victoria, causing considerable structural damage.
- **2016 South Australia Tornado Outbreak**: At least seven tornadoes occurred on September 28, 2016, leading to a state-wide power outage.

For a comprehensive list of tornadoes in Australia, refer to the [List of Australia Tornadoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Australia_tornadoes).

## Why Tornadoes Are Often Observed Around Cities

Tornadoes may seem more common around cities due to several factors:

1. **Observation and Reporting**: Urban areas have a higher population density, leading to more frequent observation and reporting of tornadoes compared to rural or remote areas.
2. **Infrastructure and Damage Visibility**: The extensive infrastructure in cities makes tornado damage more visible and impactful, increasing the likelihood of documentation.
3. **Proximity to Weather Stations**: Cities often have more weather stations and monitoring systems, leading to better detection of severe weather events.

## Why Tornadoes Are Less Frequently Observed in Some Regions

1. **Sparse Population**: Remote or sparsely populated areas may experience tornadoes that go unreported due to a lack of observers.
2. **Limited Monitoring Infrastructure**: Regions with fewer weather stations may not detect or confirm tornado activity as effectively.
3. **Geographical and Climatic Factors**: Some areas naturally have less favorable conditions for tornado formation, reducing their frequency.

## Estimated Unsighted Tornadoes

Based on detection rate adjustments and assumptions:

- **Estimated Unsighted Tornadoes per Year**: Approximately **888**.

This estimate accounts for underreporting in rural areas and higher detection rates in urban regions. These assumptions are derived from observed discrepancies in reporting rates between urban and rural areas, as well as analysis of historical data on tornado occurrences. Further refinements can be made based on updated data or methodologies.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found:** Ensure the file is downloaded and accessible on your computer.
- **Invalid File:** Verify the KML file format. It should end with `.kml` or `.kmz`.
- **Data Doesn’t Display Correctly:** Check that the KML file contains valid geographic coordinates.

## Additional Features

- **Edit Placemark Descriptions:** Right-click on a point, select **Properties**, and edit the description.
- **Adjust Visibility:** Toggle the checkboxes next to layers or points to show or hide them. This can help focus on specific areas or data points, making it easier to analyze relevant information.
- **Export Changes:** After editing, you can export the updated file by right-clicking the folder under "My Places" and selecting **Save Place As**.

By following these steps, you can easily load, view, and interact with your KML data in Google Earth Pro.
